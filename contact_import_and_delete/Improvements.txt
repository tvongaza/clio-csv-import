-The .csv file storage implmentation relies on storing the .csv file name in session, this should be changed to
minimize the session data

-There should be rake file to destroy the folders in tmp/client_folders after a determined time

-The view for undo-import needs to be modified to be clearer, so that it includes the import_undo selection and is
different from an import review. It should also be reachable without going through the import process

-Multiple addresses and phone_numbers,email_addresses,instant_messengers and web_site types should be implemented for user
flexibility
